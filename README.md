Ingredients
4 tablespoons butter softened
5 tablespoons coconut oil, vegetable oil, or canola oil
½ cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
3 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
⅓ cup buttermilk
3 cups about 6 medium grated carrots
1½ cups roasted pecans divided
Cream Cheese Frosting Recipe
Instructions
Preheat oven 350º F. Coat one baking sheet (18×13) with butter or shortening and lightly dust with flour to prevent the cake from sticking while baking. Alternately, coat well with baking spray.
Mix together butter, coconut oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Mix in vanilla extract until well incorporated. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition before adding the next. Add egg yolk making sure well combined.
Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger and salt in a medium bowl.
Add half of the flour mixture to the butter and sugar mixture and beat until well incorporated. Add buttermilk, beating until just combined before stirring in remaining flour mixture.
Fold in carrots, 1 cup of pecans and spread into the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until cakes spring back when gently touched in the center and the edges begin to turn loose from the sides of the pan, about 30 – 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the sheet pan on a wire rack for about 5 minutes.
Frost cake with cream cheese frosting and sprinkle with toasted pecans.
